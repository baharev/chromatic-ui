# Chromatic-UI

These are the open source parts (mostly UI) of Chromatic. You'll need to provide your own backend. 

## Getting started

Have a look at `javascripts/application.coffee` to get an idea of what to provide in your JS to create your own gallery.
An example gallery JSON feed can be viewed here: http://www.chromatic.io/FQrLQsb.json
